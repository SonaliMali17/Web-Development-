        A paragraph is a distinct unit of writing, typically composed of multiple sentences, that focuses on a single idea or topic. 
        It serves to organize and structure written work, making it easier for readers to follow the author's train of thought.
         A well-structured paragraph usually includes a topic sentence, supporting sentences, and sometimes a concluding sentence.
